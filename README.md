# Student-Performance-Analysis

Data Overview
This dataset, titled 'Student Performance Factors', contains information on various academic, personal, and environmental factors that may influence studentsâ€™ performance. It was cleaned and prepared in Power Query for analysis and visualization.
Data Preparation
- The dataset was imported and cleaned using Power Query.
- Null values and duplicates were removed to ensure data quality.
- Column names were standardized for readability.
- Data types were corrected where necessary (e.g., numeric vs. categorical).
- The cleaned dataset was loaded back into Excel for analysis and visualization.
Dashboard Insights 
All analytical insights are presented in the accompanying Dashboard sheet. The dashboard highlights relationships between performance and key factors such as:
- Study time and test scores
- Parental education level and performance
- Attendance or participation metrics
- Gender or socioeconomic influence on results
Analytical 
The analysis focused on identifying:
- The most significant contributors to student success
- Patterns or trends across demographic and behavioral variables
- Comparative performance across categories (e.g., gender, study time)
Tools Used
- Excel Power Query: for cleaning and transformation
- Pivot Tables & Charts: for data summarization
- Slicers: for interactivity
- Dashboard visuals: for easy interpretation of findings
Key Insights
- Students with longer study hours showed consistently higher performance.
- Parental education level had a moderate positive effect on scores.
- Attendance and engagement were strong predictors of good outcomes.
Limitations
- Data limited to the variables provided in the dataset.
- No external validation (e.g., cross-school comparison).
- Some factors (like motivation) are qualitative and not directly measured.
Next Steps
- Expand dataset with more behavioral and environmental factors.
- Build predictive models (e.g., regression or classification) for student success.
- Automate dashboard updates for future datasets.
